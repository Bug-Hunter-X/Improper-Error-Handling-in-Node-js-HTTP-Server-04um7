# Improper Error Handling in Node.js HTTP Server

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js applications: improper exception handling in HTTP servers. The `bug.js` file shows a server that fails to gracefully handle exceptions, leading to incomplete or missing responses to the client. The `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with improved error handling.

## Bug
The `bug.js` example contains a `try...catch` block, but it's missing crucial error handling within the `catch` block.  When an exception occurs, the server logs the error, but it fails to send a proper response (like an error code) back to the client, leaving the client hanging.  This is a serious issue as it affects the application's reliability and user experience.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates the correct approach.  In the `catch` block, it sends a proper HTTP error response to the client, providing feedback about the error. This ensures the client receives a response and the application remains stable.
